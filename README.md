## My AI Usage
I used an AI assistant (Google DeepMind's Antigravity) to co-author this project.

-   **Brainstorming**: The AI helped outline the project structure and task list.
-   **Boilerplate**: Generated initial Express server setup and React component structures.
-   **Testing**: Wrote Jest/Supertest test cases for TDD.
-   **Debugging**: Assisted in resolving gitignore issues and connecting frontend to backend.

The AI significantly accelerated the development process by handling repetitive tasks and providing instant feedback on code structure.
